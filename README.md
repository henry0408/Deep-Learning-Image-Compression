# Deep-Learning-Image-Compression
ELEC5306 Project2

In this project, we used deep learning and CNN as an approach to achieve the image compression and recovered the image.

PSNR, MSE, SSIM as used for judging the performance and training the network.

The final PSNR after recovering could be reached around 30dB with 30 epochs.

In Bonus, we set up a method in network to achieve the binary quantizartion for image compression and transmission:
